    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A Caribbean classic. Finely diced queen conch is mixed with seasoned batter, herbs, and spices, then deep-fried
        to a
        golden brown. Served with a zesty dipping sauce for a taste of the islands.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Conch</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using fresh conch, rinse it thoroughly under cold water to remove any sand. The meat must be tenderized,
            often by pounding it with a meat mallet or rolling pin until slightly flattened.</li>
        <li>Finely chop or mince the tenderized conch meat into small pieces. You can use a food processor for this
            step, but pulse it carefully to avoid a paste.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped conch meat, onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, and fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate smaller bowl, whisk together the beaten eggs and milk (or buttermilk/beer).</li>
        <li>Gradually pour the wet mixture into the conch mixture, stirring until everything is just combined. The
            batter should be thick and scoopable, not runny. Add a little more flour if it's too thin or a splash more
            milk if it's too thick.</li>
        <li> In a deep fryer or a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil over medium-high heat
            until it reaches 350°F (175°C). Use a deep-fry thermometer to ensure the correct temperature.</li>
        <li>Carefully drop heaping spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, working in small batches to avoid
            overcrowding the pan and dropping the oil temperature.</li>
        <li> Fry the fritters for about 3-4 minutes, turning them occasionally (or once) until they are a rich golden
            brown color and cooked through.</li>
        <li> Use a slotted spoon to remove the cooked fritters from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with
            paper towels to drain. </li>
    </ol>
